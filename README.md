><h1>Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</h1>
><h2>CMSC 451</h2>
><p>A presentation of fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing computer algorithms. The aim is to apply Big-O estimates of algorithms and proof-of-correctness techniques and to design algorithms. Basic methods include divide-and-conquer techniques, search and traversal techniques, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and induction. Programming projects are included.</p>
