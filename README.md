# CMSC-451-Projects
#### This repo contains both Project-1 and Project-2 from CMSC-451 as they are both closely related.

In Project 1, I have created a program that benchmarks the behavior of the Java implementations of the insertion sort algorithm.  This program then outputs the performance of both iterative and recursive versions of insertion sort.  You can find the rubric for Project 1 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 1 Rubric.

In Project 2, I have written up the analysis of the results that I have obtained in first project.  This writup covers the pseudocode, the Big-Î˜ analysis, the differences in performance, and more.  You can find the rubric for Project 2 in the Rubrics folder, titled Project 2 Rubric.

><h1>Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</h1>
><h2>CMSC 451</h2>
><p>A presentation of fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing computer algorithms. The aim is to apply Big-O estimates of algorithms and proof-of-correctness techniques and to design algorithms. Basic methods include divide-and-conquer techniques, search and traversal techniques, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and induction. Programming projects are included.</p>
